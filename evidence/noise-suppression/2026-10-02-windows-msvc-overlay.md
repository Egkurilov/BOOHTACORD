# Windows/MSVC RNNoise build gate

```yaml
status: IN_PROGRESS
gate: Flutter Windows Release build with native RNNoise enabled
failed_run: https://github.com/Egkurilov/BOOHTACORD/actions/runs/36991122856
failed_revision: 1c2bc0a
root_cause: MSVC rejects C99 variable-length scratch arrays in pinned RNNoise pitch.c and celt_lpc.c
repository_fix: b81128b adds CMake-generated compiler-only overlays that replace only the VLA declarations with stack-allocation calls; pinned upstream source and model remain unchanged
flutter_tests: PASS, 404 local macOS tests; these do not compile the CMake overlay
audio_tool_tests: PASS, 5 Python tests on current origin/master source tree
native_artifact_tests: PASS, 2 Windows overlay SBOM/sidecar tests
windows_release_after_fix: NOT_VERIFIED
cmake_pcm_parity_fixture: PRESENT_BUT_NOT_RUN
hardware_audio_acceptance: NOT_RUN
release_readiness: NO_GO until hosted Windows build and physical audio acceptance
```

The Flutter Windows CI #14 failure output identified C2057/C2466/C2133 at the
runtime-sized arrays. The replacement overlay is generated only in the CMake
build directory, leaving locked upstream source checksums intact. The workflow
must compile the overlay under MSVC; the optional deterministic PCM fixture
should also be run against both stock and overlay builds on a compiler that
supports VLAs before treating behavior preservation as verified. A passing
Windows build does not establish microphone quality, routing, or acoustic
acceptance.
